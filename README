This module is Beta, so don't use it on production Sites!

Dashboard aims to give registered users the possibility to create their own startpage.

Install it like every other module, but consider that you need to copy the config-folder to your Zikula-root.
This folder contains all the templates and css, because the module was generated with MOST and i will surely use MOST to generate future versions.

If you like to contribute to Dashboard i beg you to do all custom logic in the concrete classes and not within the base classes.
This will ensure that future updates via MOST can be integrated easily.

Usage:
First ensure that you have set your zikula-startpage to
  start moudule: Dashboard
  start function type: user
  start function: main

Then do the same under index.php?module=dashboard&type=admin&func=commonSettings for not logged-in users.

Feel free to try the rest.
